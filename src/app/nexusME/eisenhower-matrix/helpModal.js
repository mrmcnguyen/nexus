                The Eisenhower Matrix is a time management tool named after Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th president of the United States.
                He famously stated, "I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent."
                <br />
                <br />
                The Eisenhower Matrix has become a widely used tool in various fields, including business, personal productivity, and project management.
                Its simplicity and effectiveness have contributed to its enduring popularity.

                    These are tasks that require immediate attention and are
                    crucial for your goals. Examples include deadlines, crises, or
                    important meetings.

                  skills, or networking.

                  These tasks are pressing but don't contribute significantly to

                  These tasks are neither urgent nor important and can be
                  eliminated or delegated. Examples include social media, watching
                  TV, or mindless browsing.

              <p className="lg:text-sm 2xl:text-base text-gray-400 mb-2">Mind dump everything you need to do into the left panel. <b><u>Everything</u></b> you think you need to do. 
                Then, classify each task into each of the four quadrants by dragging them in. Now that you've mapped out all your tasks, get started!
                When you complete a task, you can mark it as done. You can also click tasks to view them, add a description/notes or rename them. You are also encouraged to delete completed
                tasks if everything gets too messy. Boom. Easy.

                    The Eisenhower Matrix focuses on the nature of prioritizing tasks. This helps you identify the most important tasks and focus on them.

                    your time more efficiently and increase the output of your work, achieving more work in less time.
